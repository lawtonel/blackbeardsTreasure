### Useful things to know
  - We are currently using [JUNIT 5](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) for testing
  - We are currently using byte code version 1.8 for building
  - For automatic set up of the lib gdx system please open intellij go to file -> open -> build.gradle -> open as project

### Where to find things
  - The src folder code has now been moved to /core
  - The assets folder is also in the core
  - Running the desktop application for the game is in the main function of /desktop/src/blackbeardtreasure/DesktopLauncher

### Authors
  - Created as part of a joint project by Aston University students
  - R1 branch shows final code at time of study, changes since then are my own
