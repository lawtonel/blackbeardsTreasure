### Resources
If you need help with set up [LIBGDX with Intellij](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Gradle-and-Intellij-IDEA) <br />
This is a great software I've been protoyping with for the map [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/download.html) <br />
Getting started with [LIBGDX and Intellij](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Using-libgdx-with-intellij-idea)

### Useful things to know
  - We are currently using [JUNIT 5](http://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) for testing
  - We are currently using byte code version 1.8 for building
  - For automatic set up of the lib gdx system please open intellij go to file -> open -> build.gradle -> open as project

### Where to find things
  - The src folder code has now been moved to /core
  - The assets folder is also in the core
  - Running the desktop application for the game is in the main function of /desktop/src/blackbeardtreasure/DesktopLauncher

### Problems Building?
  - Most of my issue resolutions are in useful things to know but any other problems feel free to message me
